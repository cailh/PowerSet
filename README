GetPowerSet(int[] set)

Given a list of numbers as a set, the method will create all of the valid subsets of this list.
The number of sub sets will be 2^S where S is the length of set.

The method loops from 0 to (2^S)-1 in order to get each permutation.
To work out which members of set belong in each permutation a method determines which bits are set in the counter.

For example:
When trying to find the 8th permutation, the counter = 7 or 111 (binary). The bits at indexes 0, 1 and 2 are set so those members of the set are extracted as a subset -> set[0], set[1], set[2].
